Chooze is an app designed to help parents worldwide with naming their children. Chooze is an early stage start-up company with the goal of becoming a leading mobile platform for expecting couples and young parents.
Chooze test is inspired by psychological science. Similar tests are being used for different measurements in multiple fields of psychological research. Chooze test is designed to look for your unconscious preferences. Our test can measure physical reactions to stimuli (Names, words etc.). The algorithm we developed uses is data to calculate which name you prefer, even in cases when you are not aware of this preference.
We are a team of psychologists, software engineers, designers & product management professionals. We’ve known each other for a long time and Chooze has always been an idea that we didn’t find time to develop. Fortunately, we’ve found the time and right team members to join the ride. We are always happy to listen to our users, if you have any suggestions or thoughts please contact us: thoughts@chooze.io
Chooze works best by measuring your physical response to different stimuli (Words, names etc.). By adding a category of names you do not like we enhance the difference between different response times, thus increasing the tests’ accuracy.
Does the test work every single time? Yes. Does it mean that the results will stay the same forever (If you enter the same names again)? No. Does it mean that the test cannot be manipulated? No.
In order to add new features, or improve existing ones, and in order to maintain our servers & software; we need to hire hard-working employees. We decided to give a few tests for free so that people can have a taste of our tool.
The measurement system used in this app is very sensitive to environmental noise. So if you were disturbed, or otherwise not concentrated, the results may have changed. In general, strong preferences are less sensitive, and the more tests you do the more stable is the result.
